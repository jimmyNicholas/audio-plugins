# Handoff: TAP as a Max for Live device

Last updated 2026-10-11 (ticket 01 passed in Live, ticket 02 next). Branch: `claude/codebase-vst-ableton-puxbqz`.

## Goal

Turn The Annoying Piano web app into a Max for Live MIDI effect that retunes notes and sends per-note pitch (MPE) to the instrument after it on the same track. Plan: [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md). Tickets: [`tickets/`](tickets/). Research: [`RESEARCH.md`](RESEARCH.md).

## Where we are

| Ticket | State |
| --- | --- |
| 01 MPE spike and repo setup | **Done.** Passed in Live on 2026-10-11; results below. |
| 02 to 05 | Not started |

## Ticket 01 results (2026-10-11)

Tested by the user with Cursor's help ([`m4l/spike/CURSOR.md`](../../m4l/spike/CURSOR.md)). Live 11.0.10, bundled Max 8.1.11, Node 20.12.2.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Independent pitch | Pass: a held white key does not move when a detuned black key comes in. |
| 2. Bend range | Pass (reported as "T"): ±100 cents on C# reads as D and C, so Live reads per-note bend as ±48 semitones. No Bend Range setting needed. |
| 3. Timing | No lag felt. The note path stays in `js`. |
| Loading | The generated `.amxd` loaded straight away, no re-save in Max. Keep generating devices from the repo. |

Live 11.0.10 is before 11.3, so the only MPE instruments available are Wavetable, Sampler and Simpler.

## Why not the VST

Ableton merges all MIDI channels into one when MIDI goes from track to track, so the VST's per-note bends never reached Wavetable (VST ticket 02). The VST in `plugin/` is parked; ask the user before deleting it. History: [`../vst/HANDOFF.md`](../vst/HANDOFF.md).

## The user's setup

- Ableton Live 11 Suite on an Intel Mac, macOS 13.7.8. Live 11 bundles Max 8.
- Uses Cursor locally. Loads the device straight from `m4l/` in the local checkout (added to Live's Places), and runs `npm test --prefix m4l`.
- Tests with Wavetable. Operator does not support MPE.

## Decisions (do not reopen without the user)

See "Decisions" in [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md). In short: Live 11 and Max 8 only; for the user's own use; v1 is three modes, their settings and Reset on a plain panel; pitch table not saved with the set; ES5 engine tested in Node; note path in `js` unless ticket 01 shows a delay; `.amxd` generated from the repo, hand-built as the fallback.

## Open questions

None from ticket 01. Questions 1 to 5 from the earlier list are answered in the results above.

## Gotchas

- **`js` in Max 8 is ES5:** no `let`, arrow functions, classes, template literals, `Map` or `Promise`. Use `Task` for timers.
- **Channel 1** is the MPE master channel. Notes on it are not treated as per-note.
- **Pushing:** check `git log origin/<branch>..HEAD` first so nothing unexpected goes up.
- **Vercel** fails on every commit on this branch for reasons unrelated to this work. Do not merge to `main`.
- **No PR** unless the user asks.
- **User preferences:** Australian spelling, no em dashes, small reviewable tickets, review before committing, ask before big changes.

## Next steps

1. Ticket 02: engine, channels and Swap ([`tickets/02-engine-swap.md`](tickets/02-engine-swap.md)). Ticket 01's results need no changes to it.
